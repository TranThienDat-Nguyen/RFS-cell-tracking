1. Introduction.

This code package can be used for the enhancement and detection of tiny 
objects (spots) seen as either local minimum or local maximum objects in 2-D
or3-D images/sequences. The code has been implemented based on the following 
paper and has been generalized for other applications:

 S. H. Rezatofighi, R. Hartley, and W. E. Hughes, “A new approach for spot 
 detection in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy,” ISBI 2012, 
 pp. 860--863.

If you use this code for research purposes, you should cite the aforementioned 
paper in any resulting publication.
 
The main file is "Main_New.m" including the necessary comments about the 
parameters and functions. All other functions are protected codes "*.p". If you 
need their "*.m" files, you can send a request to hamid.rezatofighi@anu.edu.au


Tested under windows, MATLAB (2012a).
