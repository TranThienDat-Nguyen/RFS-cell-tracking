function [oX, oY, oR] = GetWellCircle(aImData)
% Finds a circular microwell in the first image of an image sequence.
%
% The function computes the center and the radius of the microwell. The
% function is intended for images that have already been cut and will
% return the first microwell in sequences with multiple wells. The computed
% microwell information is stored in persistent variables, so that it does
% not need to be computed multiple times for the same image sequence.
%
% Inputs:
% aImData - ImageData object of the image sequence.
%
% Outputs:
% oX - X-coordinate (width coordinate) of the microwell in pixels.
% oY - Y-coordinate (height coordinate) of the microwell in pixels.
% oR - Radius of the microwell in pixels.
